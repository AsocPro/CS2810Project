Arduino Room Security

by Zachary Pratt Gibbs

This is a complete modular room security system based on the arduino.
The program is interfaced through a serial connection with the arduino
and two python daemons are ran. These python daemons make a communication
possible via XMPP to whatever device you would like to control your Room security.
One is for the communication from XMPP to the arduino and the other from the
arduino to XMPP.

The final implementation will contain a configuration script that will take in an xml
file and parse it for the configuration. This file will also build and upload
the arduino sketch in order for the full configuration to be available via the xml file.
